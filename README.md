## Installation
If you don't have AHK installed, download Everest Presets.exe.

If you do have AHK installed, you can also download the original file.

Place it into Celeste\Mods (where your blacklist.txt is). 



### Can't find Celeste\Mods?

## Use
Run it once, and it should create a preset folder.

Place your presets in that folder and run it again.

Select the individual mods or entire presets you would like to use.

Click update. This will edit your blacklist.txt. When you launch Everest, make sure to install missing dependencies. If they're already installed, this will just edit the blacklist and load them like normal.
