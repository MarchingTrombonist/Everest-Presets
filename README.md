# Everest Presets

This is a tool that allows you to create custom presets of mods for Celeste's mod launcher Olympus.

If you don't have AHK installed, download Everest Presets.exe and place it into your Celeste\Mods folder. Run it once, and it should create a preset folder.
Place your presets in that folder and run it again.
